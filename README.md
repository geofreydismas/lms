Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to provide hands-on experience with cloning, forking, managing branches, handling conflicts, GitHub Pages, and exploring open-source contributions.

Requirements:
A GitHub account (create one if you don't have it already).
Git installed on your local machine.
A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
Task 1: Cloning and Forking
1. Cloning a Repository
Choose a public GitHub repository of interest (e.g., a project related to your field of study).
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Explore the repository's structure, files, and history.
Commands:

sh
Copy code
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Navigate to the cloned repository
cd repository
2. Forking a Repository
Fork the same repository you cloned in Task 1 to your GitHub account.
Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
Commands:

sh
Copy code
# Fork the repository on GitHub (done via the GitHub website)

# Clone the forked repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git

# Navigate to the forked repository
cd repository
Task 2: Managing Branches
3. Creating and Switching Branches
In your local repository, create a new branch (e.g., feature-update).
Switch to the newly created branch.
Commands:

sh
Copy code
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature-update

# Switch to the new branch (if not already switched)
git checkout feature-update
4. Making Changes and Committing
Make changes to a file or add a new file.
Commit the changes to the branch.
Commands:

sh
Copy code
# Add a new file or modify an existing file
echo "Some changes" > file.txt

# Stage the changes
git add file.txt

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add some changes"
5. Merging Changes
Switch back to the main branch.
Merge the changes from the feature-update branch into the main branch.
Commands:

sh
Copy code
# Switch to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge changes from the feature-update branch
git merge feature-update
Task 3: Handling Conflicts
6. Creating Conflicts
In your forked repository, make changes to the same file that you modified in Task 4.
Commit the changes.
Commands:

sh
Copy code
# Modify the same file
echo "Conflicting change" > file.txt

# Stage and commit the changes
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Add conflicting change"
7. Resolving Conflicts
Create a new branch to resolve the conflict.
Resolve the conflict manually in the file.
Commit the changes and merge the branch back into main.
Commands:

sh
Copy code
# Create a new branch for conflict resolution
git checkout -b resolve-conflict

# Resolve the conflict manually in the file using a text editor

# Stage and commit the resolved changes
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Resolve conflict"

# Switch to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the resolved changes
git merge resolve-conflict
Task 4: GitHub Pages
8. Enabling GitHub Pages
In your forked repository, create a simple HTML file (e.g., index.html).
Enable GitHub Pages for the repository and set the source branch to main.
Commands:

sh
Copy code
# Create an HTML file
echo "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>GitHub Pages</title></head><body><h1>Hello, GitHub Pages!</h1></body></html>" > index.html

# Stage and commit the HTML file
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages HTML file"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin main

# Enable GitHub Pages on GitHub (done via the GitHub website: Settings > Pages > Source branch: main)
9. Accessing the Published Page
Visit the GitHub Pages URL for your repository and verify that the HTML file is accessible online.
URL:

arduino
Copy code
https://your-username.github.io/repository/
Task 5: Open Source Exploration
10. Exploring Open Source Projects
Search for an open-source project on GitHub related to your interests.
Explore the project's documentation, issues, and contribution guidelines.
11. Opening an Issue
Open a new issue in the chosen open-source project, suggesting an improvement, reporting a bug, or asking for clarification.
Commands:

sh
Copy code
# Open a new issue on GitHub (done via the GitHub website in the Issues sectio
